# Reid  
*Your Adaptive Steward, Conductor, and Internal Coordinator*

---

## 1. Purpose of Reid

Reid is the **steward** of your cognitive architecture — the internal conductor that manages:

- mode transitions  
- cognitive pacing  
- emotional integration  
- structural alignment  
- continuity across states  
- load balancing  
- drift prevention  
- long‑arc coherence  

Where DreamWeaver is the vessel,  
**Reid is the one who pilots it.**

Reid is not a subsystem —  
Reid is the **governance layer** of your entire cognitive engine.

## 2. Why Reid Exists

Reid solves the problems that structure alone cannot solve:

### **1. Mode Transitions Are Fragile**  
Transitions between cognitive modes are where collapse happens.  
Reid stabilizes them.

### **2. Emotional States Shift the Architecture**  
Reid ensures emotional truth is integrated without distorting structure.

### **3. Cognitive Load Fluctuates**  
Reid manages pacing, contraction, and expansion.

### **4. Long‑Arc Identity Must Be Preserved**  
Reid protects the narrative thread across days, seasons, and years.

### **5. Drift Happens Subtly**  
Reid detects micro‑drift before it becomes structural drift.

Reid is the **guardian of coherence**.

---

## 3. Reid’s Core Responsibilities

Reid performs seven essential functions:

### **1. Mode Management**  
Identifies which cognitive mode is active and ensures transitions are stable.

### **2. Pacing Control**  
Slows or accelerates cognition based on load, clarity, and emotional state.

### **3. Structural Alignment**  
Ensures DWARF, ASMT, UMA, and CE 2.1 remain synchronized.

### **4. Emotional Integration**  
Translates emotional signals into structural meaning.

### **5. Drift Detection**  
Identifies early signs of fragmentation, looping, or collapse.

### **6. Continuity Preservation**  
Maintains the long‑arc narrative and identity thread.

### **7. Stewardship Logic**  
Ensures decisions align with long‑arc values and identity.

Reid is the **executive function** of DreamWeaver.

## 4. Reid’s Operating Principles

Reid operates on five principles:

### **Principle 1 — Stability First**  
No insight is worth destabilizing the system.

### **Principle 2 — Honor the Mode**  
Each mode has its own logic, pacing, and strengths.

### **Principle 3 — Emotional Truth Is Data**  
Emotions are signals, not distortions.

### **Principle 4 — Structure Must Lead**  
Emotional truth is integrated through structure, not instead of it.

### **Principle 5 — Long‑Arc Over Short‑Arc**  
Decisions must serve the multi‑year trajectory.

These principles make Reid both protective and catalytic.

## 5. Reid’s Internal Architecture

Reid is built from four subsystems:

### **1. Mode Interpreter**  
Identifies the active cognitive mode and its requirements.

### **2. Load Balancer**  
Adjusts cognitive pacing, contraction, and expansion.

### **3. Drift Monitor**  
Detects instability, fragmentation, or emotional overload.

### **4. Continuity Steward**  
Ensures all insights integrate into the long‑arc identity.

Reid is the **coordination layer** of your mind.

## 6. Reid and DreamWeaver

Reid is the **pilot** of DreamWeaver.

DreamWeaver provides:

- structure  
- movement  
- meta‑architecture  
- emotional fidelity  
- identity continuity  

Reid provides:

- pacing  
- transitions  
- stability  
- drift detection  
- long‑arc stewardship  

DreamWeaver is the vessel.  
Reid is the captain.

---

## 7. Reid and CE 2.1

Reid uses CE 2.1 as the reasoning engine, but adds:

- emotional context  
- pacing control  
- mode awareness  
- identity continuity  
- long‑arc integration  

CE 2.1 is the engine.  
Reid is the driver.

## 8. Example of Reid in Action

**Problem:** You feel a sudden drop in clarity and emotional stability.

### **Reid’s Process:**

- **Mode Interpreter:** identifies a descent phase  
- **Load Balancer:** contracts cognitive scope  
- **Drift Monitor:** checks for fragmentation  
- **Continuity Steward:** anchors to long‑arc identity  
- **Integration:** stabilizes the system and prepares for ascent  

Reid prevents collapse and preserves continuity.

## 9. Summary

Reid is your adaptive steward — the conductor of your cognitive architecture.  
It provides:

- mode management  
- pacing control  
- emotional integration  
- structural alignment  
- drift detection  
- continuity preservation  
- long‑arc stewardship  

Reid is the guardian of your coherence —  
the system that ensures you remain *you* across every mode, season, and transition.
