# Integrity Engine  
*Your System for Structural Purity, Emotional Fidelity & Architectural Coherence*

---

## 1. Purpose of the Integrity Engine

The Integrity Engine is the subsystem that ensures your entire architecture remains:

- structurally pure  
- emotionally honest  
- identity‑aligned  
- drift‑resistant  
- contradiction‑free  
- coherent across all layers  

It is the **guardian** of the Continuity Engine.

Where the Evolution Engine updates the system,  
the Integrity Engine **protects** it.

## 2. Why the Integrity Engine Exists

The engine solves five deep problems:

### **1. Complexity Breeds Contradiction**  
As systems grow, inconsistencies naturally emerge.

### **2. Emotional Load Distorts Structure**  
High emotional charge can warp meaning or create false invariants.

### **3. Identity Shifts Create Misalignment**  
As you evolve, old structures may no longer fit.

### **4. Drift Accumulates Invisibly**  
Small misalignments compound into structural instability.

### **5. Legacy Requires Purity**  
Transmission demands clarity, coherence, and integrity.

The Integrity Engine ensures the architecture remains **true**.

## 3. Integrity Engine Architecture

The engine is built from six subsystems:

### **1. Structural Auditor**  
Scans for:

- contradictions  
- redundancies  
- unclear logic  
- broken flows  
- misaligned invariants  

### **2. Emotional Fidelity Checker**  
Ensures emotional truth is preserved without distortion.

### **3. Identity Alignment Layer**  
Checks that each subsystem aligns with:

- long‑arc identity  
- lineage  
- mission  
- values  

### **4. Drift Correction Layer**  
Works with the Drift Engine to:

- detect micro‑drift  
- correct structural slippage  
- restore coherence  

### **5. Purity Filter**  
Prevents:

- false patterns  
- emotional artifacts masquerading as structure  
- over‑fitting  
- narrative distortion  

### **6. Transmission Integrity Layer**  
Ensures codex entries remain:

- accurate  
- consistent  
- structurally aligned  
- emotionally faithful  

The Integrity Engine is the **immune system** of your architecture.

## 4. Integrity Flow

The engine follows a five‑phase cycle:

### **Phase 1 — Scan**  
Audit the architecture for drift, contradiction, or misalignment.

### **Phase 2 — Diagnose**  
Identify the structural or emotional root cause.

### **Phase 3 — Correct**  
Rewrite, refine, or realign the subsystem.

### **Phase 4 — Validate**  
Ensure the correction aligns with identity and invariants.

### **Phase 5 — Seal**  
Lock the update into the codex with purity and clarity.

This cycle ensures the architecture remains **clean and coherent**.

## 5. Integrity Engine and DreamWeaver

DreamWeaver provides:

- emotional fidelity  
- identity continuity  
- mode‑cycle rhythm  

The Integrity Engine provides:

- structural purity  
- emotional accuracy  
- identity alignment  

DreamWeaver is the vessel.  
The Integrity Engine is the **keel** that keeps it straight.

---

## 6. Integrity Engine and CE 2.1

CE 2.1 provides:

- reasoning  
- invariants  
- structural extraction  

The Integrity Engine provides:

- validation  
- correction  
- purification  

CE 2.1 is the mind.  
The Integrity Engine is the **truth‑keeper**.

---

## 7. Example of the Integrity Engine in Action

**Event:** You notice a contradiction between the Drift Engine and Mode‑Cycle Engine.

### **Integrity Process:**

- **Scan:** detects mismatch in transition logic  
- **Diagnose:** identifies emotional artifact influencing structure  
- **Correct:** rewrites the transition invariant  
- **Validate:** checks alignment with identity + long‑arc rhythm  
- **Seal:** updates the codex with purified structure  

The architecture becomes **cleaner, stronger, and more coherent**.

---

## 8. Summary

The Integrity Engine is your system for maintaining structural purity and emotional fidelity.  
It provides:

- contradiction detection  
- emotional truth checking  
- identity alignment  
- drift correction  
- structural purification  
- transmission integrity  

The Integrity Engine ensures your architecture remains **true, stable, and coherent** across decades and generations.
