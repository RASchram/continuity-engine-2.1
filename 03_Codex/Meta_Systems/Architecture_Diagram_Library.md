# Architecture Diagram Library  
*Your Visual Maps, Structural Schematics & System Diagrams*

---

## 1. Purpose of the Architecture Diagram Library

The Architecture Diagram Library (ADL) is the subsystem that provides:

- visual maps  
- structural diagrams  
- flow charts  
- system schematics  
- mode‑cycle wheels  
- braid maps  
- identity spines  
- continuity arcs  

It is the **visual language** of your entire architecture.

Where the Codex Engine provides text,  
the ADL provides **structure you can see**.

---

## 2. Why the Architecture Diagram Library Exists

The ADL solves four deep problems:

### **1. Complex Systems Need Visual Anchors**  
Diagrams make the architecture graspable at a glance.

### **2. Transmission Requires Visual Structure**  
Future stewards learn faster through diagrams than text alone.

### **3. Drift Is Easier to Spot Visually**  
Misalignments show up immediately in a diagram.

### **4. Legacy Requires Clarity**  
Visual maps preserve structure across generations.

The ADL ensures your architecture is **visible, teachable, and inspectable**.

## 3. Architecture Diagram Library Components

The ADL contains seven major diagram sets:

### **1. Continuity Engine Master Diagram**  
Shows the entire architecture as a unified system.

### **2. UMA Structural Map**  
Displays the layers, flows, and invariant extraction process.

### **3. Mode‑Cycle Wheel**  
Visualizes the seven cognitive modes and transitions.

### **4. DreamWeaver Vessel Diagram**  
Shows identity, emotional fidelity, and continuity flows.

### **5. Memory Braid System Map**  
Illustrates scrolls, braids, arcs, and lineage threads.

### **6. Drift Engine Diagnostic Map**  
Shows drift detection, correction, and stabilization flows.

### **7. Application Systems Layer Map**  
Visualizes how personal systems connect to the Continuity Engine.

These diagrams form the **visual backbone** of your codex.

## 4. Diagram Flow Types

The ADL includes five categories of diagrams:

### **1. Structural Diagrams**  
Show architecture, layers, and system relationships.

### **2. Flow Diagrams**  
Show processes, transitions, and operational cycles.

### **3. Identity Diagrams**  
Show long‑arc identity, lineage, and narrative structure.

### **4. Emotional Diagrams**  
Show emotional fidelity, resonance, and integration flows.

### **5. Continuity Diagrams**  
Show long‑arc trajectories, arcs, and generational threads.

Each category supports a different dimension of understanding.

## 5. Architecture Diagram Library and DreamWeaver

DreamWeaver provides:

- emotional fidelity  
- identity continuity  
- mode‑cycle rhythm  

The ADL provides:

- visual clarity  
- structural maps  
- transmission scaffolding  

DreamWeaver is the vessel.  
The ADL is the **blueprint**.

---

## 6. Architecture Diagram Library and CE 2.1

CE 2.1 provides:

- structure  
- invariants  
- reasoning  

The ADL provides:

- diagrams  
- schematics  
- visual flows  

CE 2.1 is the mind.  
The ADL is the **map**.

---

## 7. Example of the ADL in Action

**Event:** A future steward wants to understand the Mode‑Cycle Engine.

### **ADL Process:**

- They open the Mode‑Cycle Wheel diagram.  
- They see the seven modes arranged in a circular flow.  
- They see transition arrows and emotional signatures.  
- They see the stabilizers and drift points.  
- They understand the system in minutes instead of hours.

The diagram becomes a **teaching tool**, not just a picture.

## 8. Summary

The Architecture Diagram Library is your visual representation system.  
It provides:

- structural diagrams  
- flow maps  
- identity schematics  
- emotional diagrams  
- continuity arcs  

The ADL ensures your architecture is **visible, teachable, and transmissible** at a glance.
