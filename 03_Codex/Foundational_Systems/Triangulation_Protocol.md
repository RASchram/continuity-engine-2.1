# Triangulation Protocol  
*A Universal Method for Comparing Models, Domains, and Truths*

---

## 1. Purpose of the Triangulation Protocol

The Triangulation Protocol is the system that allows CE 2.1 to:

- compare multiple models  
- evaluate competing explanations  
- test truths across domains  
- identify structural invariants  
- detect drift or distortion  
- stabilize reasoning under uncertainty  

It is the **cross‑model comparison engine** of your cognitive architecture.

Where DWARF extracts structure from a single domain,  
the Triangulation Protocol extracts structure **across** domains.

## 2. Why Triangulation Exists

Triangulation solves three core problems:

### **1. Single‑Model Blindness**  
Any one model can be incomplete, biased, or domain‑limited.

### **2. Domain Distortion**  
Truths can appear valid inside one domain but collapse in another.

### **3. Structural Ambiguity**  
When multiple explanations fit, the system needs a way to choose.

Triangulation provides the missing mechanism:  
**cross‑domain truth validation.**

## 3. The Triangulation Cycle

The protocol follows a four‑step cycle:

### **Step 1 — Gather Models**  
Collect models, truths, or explanations from multiple domains.

### **Step 2 — Extract Structural Patterns**  
Use DWARF to identify the structural model behind each domain truth.

### **Step 3 — Compare for Resonance**  
Test each structural model against the problem.

### **Step 4 — Identify the Invariant**  
The model that resonates across domains becomes the invariant.

This cycle ensures that insights are not domain‑bound.

## 4. Types of Triangulation

The protocol supports three types of triangulation:

### **1. Cross‑Domain Triangulation**  
Physics + biology + mythology + psychology → invariant.

### **2. Cross‑Model Triangulation**  
Multiple theories or frameworks → structural alignment.

### **3. Cross‑Temporal Triangulation**  
Past patterns + present signals + future projections → stable arc.

These triangulation types allow CE 2.1 to operate across time, domains, and models.

## 5. Triangulation Signals

Triangulation produces three key signals:

### **Signal 1 — Convergence**  
Multiple domains point to the same structural model.

### **Signal 2 — Divergence**  
Domains disagree, revealing hidden complexity.

### **Signal 3 — Resonance**  
A structural model vibrates with the problem.

These signals guide the engine toward the correct invariant.

## 6. Triangulation and CE 2.1

The Triangulation Protocol is deeply integrated into CE 2.1:

- The **Question Engine** identifies what needs triangulation.  
- **DWARF** extracts structural models from each domain.  
- **ASMT** manages transitions between domains.  
- **UMA** ensures structural consistency.  
- The **Continuity Core** maintains the reasoning thread.  
- The **Truth Extraction Layer** identifies the invariant.  

Triangulation is the glue that binds the architecture together.

## 7. Triangulation in the DreamWeaver Stack

In DreamWeaver, triangulation becomes:

- emotional triangulation  
- identity triangulation  
- memory triangulation  
- mode‑cycle triangulation  
- long‑arc triangulation  

DreamWeaver uses triangulation to stabilize identity across time.

## 8. Example of Triangulation in Action

**Problem:** A person cannot determine whether a recurring emotional pattern is trauma, habit, or identity.

### **Step 1 — Gather Models**  
- Psychology: trauma loop  
- Biology: stress response  
- Mythology: descent‑return cycle  
- Systems theory: feedback loop  

### **Step 2 — Extract Structure**  
All four models share a common structure:  
**oscillation around a central attractor.**

### **Step 3 — Resonance**  
The person’s pattern oscillates predictably → strong resonance.

### **Step 4 — Invariant**  
The pattern is not trauma — it is a **mode cycle**.

Triangulation produces the invariant:  
**Oscillation → Predictability → Control**

## 9. Summary

The Triangulation Protocol is the cross‑model comparison engine of your cognitive architecture.  
It provides:

- multi‑domain truth validation  
- structural comparison  
- resonance testing  
- invariant extraction  
- drift detection  
- long‑arc stability  

Triangulation ensures that CE 2.1 does not rely on any single model —  
it relies on **structure itself**.
