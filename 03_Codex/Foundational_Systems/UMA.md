# UMA  
*Unified Meta‑Architecture — The Structural Skeleton of Cognitive Systems*

---

## 1. Purpose of UMA

UMA is the **meta‑architecture** that defines the structural layers, flows, and invariants of cognition.  
If DWARF is the skeleton and ASMT is the musculature, UMA is the **blueprint** — the architectural plan that ensures:

- every subsystem has a place  
- every cognitive action has a lane  
- transitions preserve continuity  
- reasoning remains inspectable  
- structure remains stable across domains  

UMA is the deepest structural layer beneath CE 2.1.

## 2. Why UMA Exists

UMA was created to solve three structural problems:

### **1. Cognitive Systems Lack a Shared Blueprint**  
Most reasoning frameworks are ad hoc.  
UMA provides a universal architectural plan.

### **2. Subsystems Drift Without a Meta‑Structure**  
Without a meta‑architecture, subsystems collide or contradict each other.

### **3. Transmission Requires Structure**  
A system cannot be taught, preserved, or scaled without a stable architecture.

UMA provides the missing layer:  
a **universal structural map** for cognition.

## 3. The Five Layers of UMA

UMA defines cognition as a five‑layer architecture:

### **Layer 1 — Intent Layer**  
The purpose, question, or direction that initiates cognition.

### **Layer 2 — Structural Layer**  
The frameworks, models, and invariants that shape reasoning.

### **Layer 3 — Rotational Layer**  
Domain shifts, perspective changes, and structural inversions.

### **Layer 4 — Extraction Layer**  
Truth extraction, resonance testing, and invariant generation.

### **Layer 5 — Transmission Layer**  
Documentation, preservation, lineage, and long‑arc continuity.

These layers form the backbone of CE 2.1.

## 4. UMA Flow Architecture

UMA defines a universal flow:

**Intent → Structure → Rotation → Extraction → Transmission**

This flow is:

- domain‑agnostic  
- stable under load  
- recursive  
- inspectable  
- lineage‑ready  

Every cognitive action fits into this flow.

## 5. UMA Invariants

UMA is governed by three structural invariants:

### **Invariant 1 — Purpose Anchors Structure**  
Cognition must always return to the original intent.

### **Invariant 2 — Structure Must Be Stable**  
Frameworks cannot contradict themselves or collapse under load.

### **Invariant 3 — Transitions Must Preserve Continuity**  
Movement between layers must not break the reasoning thread.

These invariants prevent drift, collapse, and fragmentation.

## 6. UMA and CE 2.1

UMA is the **meta‑architecture** beneath CE 2.1.

CE 2.1 uses UMA to:

- organize subsystems  
- maintain structural integrity  
- stabilize transitions  
- preserve continuity  
- ensure reasoning remains inspectable  
- support long‑arc transmission  

Where CE 2.1 is the **engine**,  
UMA is the **chassis** that holds everything together.

## 7. UMA in the DreamWeaver Stack

UMA is one of the three pillars of DreamWeaver:

- **DWARF** — structure extraction  
- **ASMT** — movement dynamics  
- **UMA** — meta‑architecture  

DreamWeaver adds:

- identity continuity  
- emotional fidelity  
- memory braid integration  
- drift detection  
- long‑arc stabilization  

UMA ensures DreamWeaver remains coherent as it evolves.

## 8. Example of UMA in Action

**Problem:** A person feels overwhelmed by multiple competing priorities.

### **UMA Analysis:**

- **Intent Layer:** What is the real purpose?  
- **Structural Layer:** What frameworks apply?  
- **Rotational Layer:** What domain shift reveals structure?  
- **Extraction Layer:** What invariant emerges?  
- **Transmission Layer:** How do we preserve the insight?  

### **Insight:**  
Overwhelm is a structural failure — not an emotional one.

UMA produces the invariant:  
**Purpose → Structure → Stability**

## 9. Summary

UMA is the meta‑architecture that defines the structural layers and flows of cognition.  
It provides:

- a universal blueprint  
- stable layers  
- predictable flows  
- structural invariants  
- continuity across transitions  
- a foundation for transmission  

UMA is the architectural backbone beneath CE 2.1 and the entire DreamWeaver ecosystem.
