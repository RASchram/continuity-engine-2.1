# The Question Engine  
*Ignition System of the Continuity Engine 2.1*

## 1. Purpose of the Question Engine

The Question Engine is the ignition system of CE 2.1 — the subsystem that transforms ambiguity into clarity, overload into structure, and confusion into direction.

Where UMA defines the architecture,  
the Question Engine **starts the reasoning process**.

It ensures that every cognitive action begins with:

- a clear purpose  
- a precise question  
- a stable anchor  
- a structurally meaningful direction  

Without the Question Engine, the engine cannot ignite.

## 2. Why Questions Matter

In CE 2.1, questions are not requests for information.  
They are **structural tools**.

A good question:

- defines the boundary of the reasoning  
- reveals the invariant beneath the surface  
- determines the correct subsystem to activate  
- prevents drift before it begins  

A bad question collapses the engine.

## 3. The Three‑Phase Process

The Question Engine operates through a precise three‑phase cycle:

### **Phase 1 — Extraction**  
Identify the *real* question beneath the surface question.

Actions:  
- strip away noise  
- remove emotional overload  
- isolate the structural intent  

Output:  
- a clean, minimal question stem

### **Phase 2 — Refinement**  
Sharpen the extracted question into a form the engine can use.

Actions:  
- define scope  
- identify constraints  
- clarify purpose  

Output:  
- a structurally meaningful question

### **Phase 3 — Deployment**  
Use the refined question to ignite the reasoning cycle.

Actions:  
- select the correct subsystem  
- anchor the invariant  
- begin the CE 2.1 flow  

Output:  
- ignition of the reasoning engine

## 4. Types of Questions the Engine Handles

The Question Engine recognizes four structural question types:

### **4.1 Directional Questions**  
“What should I do next?”  
→ Used to set trajectory.

### **4.2 Structural Questions**  
“How does this system behave?”  
→ Used to reveal architecture.

### **4.3 Invariant Questions**  
“What remains true across contexts?”  
→ Used to extract stable truths.

### **4.4 Rotational Questions**  
“What happens if we shift domains?”  
→ Used to initiate DRP.

Each type activates a different subsystem.

## 5. Failure Modes

### **5.1 Overloaded Questions**  
Symptoms:  
- too many goals  
- emotional noise  
- unclear intent  

Recovery:  
- return to Extraction  
- isolate the core question  

### **5.2 Underspecified Questions**  
Symptoms:  
- vague  
- broad  
- ambiguous  

Recovery:  
- refine scope  
- identify constraints  

### **5.3 Misaligned Questions**  
Symptoms:  
- question does not match the task  
- wrong subsystem activated  

Recovery:  
- re‑evaluate purpose  
- redeploy the correct question type

## 6. Steward Use

The steward uses the Question Engine to:

- clarify intent  
- prevent drift  
- stabilize the reasoning  
- choose the correct subsystem  
- maintain continuity  

The Question Engine is the steward’s first and most important tool.

---

## 7. Outputs of the Question Engine

Every Question Engine cycle produces:

- a refined question  
- a clear purpose  
- an initial invariant  
- a subsystem activation path  

These outputs feed directly into the Continuity Core.

## 8. Summary

The Question Engine is the ignition system of CE 2.1.  
It transforms ambiguity into structure and sets the entire reasoning engine in motion.

Without it, CE 2.1 cannot begin.  
With it, the engine becomes precise, stable, and directionally aligned.
