# UMA — Unified Meta‑Architecture  
*The Structural Backbone of the Continuity Engine 2.1*

---

## 1. Purpose of UMA

UMA (Unified Meta‑Architecture) is the structural framework that defines how every subsystem in CE 2.1 interacts.  
It is the **macro‑architecture** — the skeleton that ensures:

- every cognitive action has a place  
- every subsystem has a role  
- every transition preserves continuity  
- every reasoning flow is traceable and reproducible  

UMA is not a model.  
It is the **architecture that models run inside**.

## 2. Core Principles of UMA

UMA is built on three invariants:

### **Invariant 1 — Purpose Anchors Structure**  
Every cognitive action must be tied to a clear purpose.  
If purpose is lost, structure collapses.

### **Invariant 2 — Subsystems Must Produce Stable Outputs**  
Each subsystem (Question Engine, DRP, Continuity Core, etc.) must generate predictable, inspectable outputs.

### **Invariant 3 — Transitions Must Preserve Continuity**  
Movement between subsystems must never break the reasoning thread.

These invariants ensure UMA remains stable across domains, contexts, and operators.

## 3. UMA Layer Overview

UMA organizes CE 2.1 into five layers:

1. **Intent Layer**  
   Defines the purpose, question, and direction.

2. **Structural Layer**  
   Houses the Question Engine and Continuity Core.

3. **Rotational Layer**  
   Contains the Domain Rotation Protocol.

4. **Extraction Layer**  
   Produces invariants and structural insights.

5. **Transmission Layer**  
   Handles documentation, versioning, and lineage.

Each layer is independent but interlocking.

## 4. UMA Flow

A standard UMA flow looks like this:
