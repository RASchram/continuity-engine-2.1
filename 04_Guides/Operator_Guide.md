# Operator Guide  
*How to Run the Continuity Engine 2.1*

---

## 1. Purpose of This Guide

The Operator Guide teaches a steward how to run the Continuity Engine 2.1 in real time.  
It is not a theoretical document.  
It is a **practical manual** — the set of actions, checks, and flows that keep the engine stable.

If the Codex defines the architecture,  
the Operator Guide defines the **craft**.

## 2. Steward Role Overview

A steward is responsible for:

- maintaining continuity  
- enforcing structure  
- guiding domain rotation  
- extracting invariants  
- preventing drift  
- preserving the thread of intent  
- documenting and transmitting the reasoning  

A steward does not dominate the system.  
A steward **holds the thread**.

## 3. Core Operating Principles

Every operator must internalize these principles:

### **3.1 Continuity First**
Never break the reasoning thread.  
If continuity is lost, restore it before proceeding.

### **3.2 Structure Over Content**
The engine cares more about *how* thought moves than *what* it contains.

### **3.3 Slow Is Smooth, Smooth Is Fast**
Rushing collapses structure.  
Deliberate pacing stabilizes the engine.

### **3.4 Invariants Are the Anchor**
Every reasoning cycle must produce at least one invariant.

### **3.5 Rotation Is Controlled, Not Chaotic**
Domain shifts must be intentional and anchored.

## 4. The Standard CE 2.1 Reasoning Cycle

Every reasoning session follows this six‑step flow:

### **Step 1 — Ignition (Question Engine)**
Clarify the real question.  
Strip away noise.  
Identify the structural intent.

### **Step 2 — Stabilization (Continuity Core)**
Anchor the thread.  
Define the purpose.  
Set the boundaries.

### **Step 3 — Rotation (DRP)**
Shift domains to reveal new structure.  
Re‑express the invariant in the new domain.

### **Step 4 — Extraction (Invariants)**
Identify what remains true across domains.  
This becomes the engine’s stable output.

### **Step 5 — Integration (UMA)**
Assemble the insights into a coherent structure.  
Ensure every part fits the architecture.

### **Step 6 — Transmission**
Document the result.  
Version it.  
Preserve it for future reasoning.

This cycle is universal across all domains.

## 5. Operating the Subsystems

### **5.1 Question Engine**
Use when:
- the question is unclear  
- the intent is overloaded  
- the reasoning is drifting  

Actions:
- extract → refine → deploy  
- convert ambiguity into structure  

### **5.2 Domain Rotation Protocol**
Use when:
- insight stalls  
- perspective narrows  
- the system loops  

Actions:
- anchor → rotate → re‑express → extract → return  

### **5.3 Continuity Core**
Use continuously to:
- maintain the thread  
- enforce structural integrity  
- prevent collapse  

### **5.4 Transmission Layer**
Use at the end of every cycle:
- document  
- version  
- preserve

## 6. Failure Modes and Recovery

### **6.1 Drift**
Symptoms:
- losing the question  
- wandering domains  
- inconsistent logic  

Recovery:
- return to the last invariant  
- re‑anchor the thread  

### **6.2 Collapse**
Symptoms:
- contradiction  
- overload  
- incoherence  

Recovery:
- restart from Ignition  
- rebuild structure  

### **6.3 Stagnation**
Symptoms:
- no new insight  
- circular reasoning  

Recovery:
- initiate DRP  
- rotate domains

## 7. Steward Checklist

Before starting:
- What is the real question?  
- What is the purpose of this reasoning?  
- What is the initial invariant?  

During operation:
- Is continuity preserved?  
- Is structure intact?  
- Is rotation controlled?  

After completion:
- What invariant was extracted?  
- What structure was built?  
- What must be transmitted?

## 8. Closing

Operating CE 2.1 is a discipline.  
It rewards clarity, patience, and structural thinking.  
The steward’s job is not to force insight, but to create the conditions where insight becomes inevitable.

Hold the thread.  
Honor the structure.  
Preserve the engine.
