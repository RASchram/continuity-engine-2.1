# Continuity Engine 2.1 — Foundations

## 1. Purpose of this document
This document establishes the theoretical foundations of the Continuity Engine 2.1 (CE 2.1).  
It defines the core concepts, constraints, and assumptions that underlie the architecture and its operation.

## 2. Core problem CE 2.1 addresses
- **Fragmentation of cognition across time, domains, and states**
- **Loss of continuity between insights, decisions, and identity**
- **Lack of reusable, domain-agnostic structure for thinking**

CE 2.1 responds by treating cognition as a **continuity problem** rather than a content problem.

## 3. Core concepts

### 3.1 Continuity
Continuity is the maintained thread between:
- past states  
- present decisions  
- future commitments  

CE 2.1 treats continuity as a **first-class design constraint**, not an emergent property.

### 3.2 Invariants
Invariants are structural truths that must hold across:
- domains  
- modes  
- stewards  
- time  

They are the “laws of motion” for CE 2.1 and are formalized in `Invariants.md`.

### 3.3 Cognitive architecture
CE 2.1 assumes:
- cognition is **layered** (personal, operational, meta, transmission)  
- structure can be **made explicit** and reused  
- systems can be **run like software**, even when embodied in humans

### 3.4 Steward-as-instrument
The steward is not outside the system.  
The steward is the **primary instrument** through which CE 2.1 operates.  
Personal systems (identity, mode-cycling, resonance) are therefore part of the architecture, not an afterthought.

## 4. Design principles

### 4.1 Domain-agnostic
CE 2.1 must function across:
- technical domains  
- emotional processing  
- strategy  
- research  
- creative work  

No domain gets special treatment.

### 4.2 Explicit structure
Where most cognition is implicit, CE 2.1:
- externalizes structure  
- names mechanisms  
- makes flows inspectable and teachable  

### 4.3 Recursivity
The system must:
- operate on itself  
- refine its own protocols  
- update its own architecture without losing identity  

### 4.4 Transmission-first
CE 2.1 is built not just to work, but to be:
- taught  
- inherited  
- extended  
- stewarded across generations  

## 5. Relationship to other documents
- `Architecture.md` describes **how** these foundations are instantiated structurally.
- `Invariants.md` formalizes the non-negotiable rules implied here.
- `Methods.md` explains how these foundations were derived, tested, and refined.

## 6. Status
- Version: 0.1 (Foundations scaffold)
- Steward: Richard Allen Schram Jr (Pappy)
- Notes: This document is intentionally concise and may be expanded as CE 2.1 evolves.
