# Continuity Engine 2.1 — Methods

## 1. Purpose of this document
This document explains the methods used to develop, validate, and refine the Continuity Engine 2.1 (CE 2.1).  
It captures the research approach, reasoning processes, and iterative cycles that shaped the system.

Where `Foundations.md` explains *why* CE exists,  
and `Architecture.md` explains *how* CE is structured,  
**Methods.md explains *how CE was built*.**

## 2. Research Approach

### 2.1 Structural Cognition
CE 2.1 was developed using a structural cognition approach:
- prioritize patterns over content  
- extract invariants across domains  
- identify universal flows  
- test structures recursively  

This approach ensures CE is domain‑agnostic and transferable.

---

### 2.2 Cross‑Domain Sampling
Every subsystem was tested across:
- technical domains  
- emotional processing  
- strategy  
- creative work  
- troubleshooting  
- personal decision‑making  

A structure was only accepted if it held across all sampled domains.

---

### 2.3 Mode‑Cycle Testing (UMA)
Subsystems were validated across multiple cognitive/emotional modes:
- high‑energy  
- low‑energy  
- reflective  
- reactive  
- expansive  
- collapsed  

A subsystem that only worked in one mode was rejected or redesigned.

---

### 2.4 Steward‑in‑the‑Loop
The steward (Pappy) was treated as an active research instrument:
- somatic resonance used for domain selection  
- mode shifts tracked as part of the system  
- identity stack used to test continuity  
- lived experience used as a data source  

This ensured CE 2.1 remained grounded in real cognition, not abstraction.

## 3. Iterative Development Cycles

### 3.1 Expansion Cycles
Used to generate:
- new subsystems  
- new protocols  
- new invariants  
- new architectural layers  

Expansion cycles prioritize breadth and discovery.

---

### 3.2 Inversion Cycles
Used to test:
- failure modes  
- contradictions  
- blind spots  
- structural weaknesses  

Inversion cycles attempt to break the system on purpose.

---

### 3.3 Refinement Cycles
Used to:
- simplify  
- compress  
- clarify  
- remove redundancy  
- strengthen invariants  

Refinement cycles ensure CE remains elegant and teachable.

---

### 3.4 Strengthening Cycles
Used to:
- reinforce invariants  
- stress‑test subsystems  
- validate cross‑domain truths  
- ensure continuity under load  

These cycles produce the “CE‑grade” stability guarantees.

---

## 4. Validation Methods

### 4.1 Stress Tests
Subsystems were subjected to:
- contradictory inputs  
- ambiguous problems  
- emotional volatility  
- rapid domain switching  
- high‑pressure decision scenarios  

Only structures that maintained continuity survived.

---

### 4.2 Drift Detection
CE was tested for:
- conceptual drift  
- emotional drift  
- domain drift  
- identity drift  

Recovery patterns were refined based on observed drift modes.

---

### 4.3 Steward Variation
Subsystems were tested under:
- different internal states  
- different cognitive rhythms  
- different emotional loads  

This ensured CE 2.1 is stable across steward variability.

---

## 5. Relationship to other documents
- `Foundations.md` defines the theoretical base.  
- `Architecture.md` describes the structural implementation.  
- `Invariants.md` defines the rules that emerged from these methods.

## 6. Status
- Version: 0.1 (Methods scaffold)
- Steward: Richard Allen Schram Jr (Pappy)
- Notes: Methods may expand as CE evolves or new research cycles are added.
